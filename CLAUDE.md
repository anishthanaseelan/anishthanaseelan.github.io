# Claude Session Notes

## Future TODOs

### 1. Expand Work Experience Content
- Expand the Work Experience section to include **eDC** (e-Commerce Distribution Centre) and **Imports** in more detail
- Give content weight proportional to number of years spent on each engagement
- Currently the timeline highlights are brief — enrich with scope, scale, and outcomes

### 2. Notable Achievements — Mature and Update
- Review existing Notable Achievements entries for tone and maturity
- Add recent achievements (post-ASDA Divestiture era)
- Ensure achievements reflect current seniority and impact level

### 3. Add China CBTA Experience
- Add China Cross-Border Trade Automation (CBTA) experience to Work Experience section
- Include relevant project details, scope, and outcomes

### 4. Add Claude Code & Agent Development Experience
- Add experience with Claude Code (Anthropic's AI coding assistant)
- Document Code Puppy agents and sub-agent creation work
- Include related AI/LLM integration use cases and implementations
